# Part1 ------------------

Problem Statement :

                    What is the ID of the earliest bus you can take to the airport multiplied by the number of minutes you'll need to wait for that bus?
                    
                    
Code :              

                    multiples = []
                    
                    with open("input.txt") as file:
                      for line in file:
                          line = line.replace("\n","")
                          if line.isdigit() != True:
                              multiples = [int(r) for r in line.split(",") if r != "x"]
                              
                    num = 1000417
                    remainder = []
                    
                    
                    for i in multiples:
                        if num % i == 0:
                            remainder.append(0)
                        else:
                            y = (i * ((num//i)+1)) - num
                            remainder.append(y)

                    x = min(remainder)
                    index = remainder.index(x)
                    print(multiples[index]*x)
                    
--- Part Two ---

Problem Statement : 

                    What is the earliest timestamp such that all of the listed bus IDs depart at offsets matching their positions in the list?

Note :          
                    This is a valid algorithm but not optimal as  even multiple list greate rthan 5 will take a very long time as the number is in billions.

Code :  

                    multiple,index = [],[]
                    
                    with open("input.txt") as file:
                      for line in file:
                          line = line.replace("\n","")
                          if line.isdigit() != True:
                              raw = line.split(",")
                              for r in range(len(raw)):
                                  if raw[r] != "x":
                                      multiple.append(int(raw[r]))
                                      index.append(r)
                                      
                                      
                    i = 0
                    while True:
                        flag = 0
                        for j in range(len(multiple)):
                            # print(i ,j,multiple[j] , index[j],i%multiple[j] , ((multiple[j] * ((i//multiple[j])+1)) - i))
                            if j == 0 and (i%multiple[j]) == index[j]:
                                flag = 1
                            elif  j!= 0 and flag ==1 and ((multiple[j] * ((i//multiple[j])+1)) - i) == index[j]:
                                flag = 1
                            else:
                                flag = 0
                                break
                        # print("------------------")
                        if flag == 1:
                            print(i)
                            break
                        flag = 0
                        i += 1
